Very interesting foray into shoegaze rock, it all came because I love one Chinese shoegaze band called Default, I like the female singer voice very much, but gradually turns to admire the wonderful producer Eric, who basically does all the production stuff, and he is really talented. This song is referring their famous song 《将死之时掩以水门汀》. I also kind of have the depression that no one really enjoys my music, so I’d take that depression and compose some experimental music, which makes no substantial difference. 

Glad that it doesn’t need really high-quality vocal, but it’s hard to write all the instrument parts as there are not a lot of instruments playing so the technique and details are amplified much, and since it is super long, I need to organize how I should set the surprise point over the whole song, every 4/8 bars. 

Mixing is also hard as it is easy to mess up since there are loads of reverb and delay going on. It takes me time to try and reflect and try again, several times. 

Anyways I still enjoy this song,  highly recommend you guys listen to it by headphones, the stereo experience is an excellent medium for conveying the atmosphere of shoegaze rock!
