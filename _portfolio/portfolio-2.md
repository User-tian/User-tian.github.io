[Music Link]()

This song marks my foray into electronic music. It's a departure from my previous work, as it's the first time I've composed a piece without lyrics, instead focusing on conveying emotions solely through melody and percussion. This project also marked my initial foray into learning mixing and the application of various mixing techniques in music production. I was capable of all the procedures in this music, and it was a significant learning experience for me. The central message of the song is the idea of persevering through life's ups and downs, advocating for resilience and openness. I really enjoy the usage of voice slices, as it brings to the song a sense of bleakness and haze. During the mixing stage, I carefully adjusted the ratio of different instruments and sculpted the sound of each instrument to achieve a harmonious auditory blend, enhancing the overall listening experience.
