This is an implementation of Genetic Algorithm for Music Variation. Due to lack of music variation datasets, I applied genetic algorithm instead of machine learning tools to address the task. The focus of this endeavor is on variation due to the hierarchical structure of the Music And-or-Graph for controlled music generation with limited training data. The system takes a 2-8 bar music phrase as input and produces an output phrase with a corresponding number of bars. To align with the unique requirements of the task, I made significant modifications to the crossover and mutation operators, customizing them to better suit the specific demands of the algorithm. I also designed several fitness functions to evaluate the performance of the generated melody. Aimed to align with the And-or-Graph, the system is controllable for different types of melody and different forms of variation.
