This song was written for the March 2024 student event at Tsinghua University’s Department of Automation. I am in charge of the lyrics composition, melody composition, arrangement, and part of the singing (the first vocal from the beginning). This song is mainly about looking back at the past times in the university on the eve of graduation, expressing the cherishing of the past and the longing for the future dream.

The main difficulty I’ve faced is that the overall style of the song must align with the theme of the festival. The rock band collection is not an arrangement I am skilled at writing; I am more comfortable writing love songs or sad songs. I eventually overcame these difficulties and I’m really proud of this piece.
