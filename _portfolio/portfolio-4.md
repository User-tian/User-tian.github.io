This is an implementation of the paper “Exploring Unified Perspective For Fast Shapley Value Estimation”. I am responsible for all the experimental code and the paper composition relating to experiments. The idea of unifying came from our discussion, as we found no essential difference among different Shapley values estimation methods. Concurrently, we investigate the possibility of designing simple amortized estimators and propose a straightforward and efficient one, **SimSHAP**. 

This is my first scientific research experience, I’m thrilled to have actively engaged in all stages of the project, which has significantly deepened my understanding of the research process and contributed to the enhancement of my coding and writing skills.
