This song marks my successful trial in Chinese R&B music. I find it hard to write a real R&B song several years ago until I heard the masterpices of Dean Ting, a famous R&B composer in China, so I wrote a song based on his R&B song "Detective". The arrangement is more funky and I'm thrilled to have the guitar midi-programmed to be so real. The "Woowaa" in the bridge is a tribute to David Tao “Butterfly". The use of pop horns is also a very interesting part, adding a whole new layer to the song. 

I seldom write groovy songs as I find it hard to keep the groove consistent thoughout the whole song, while this time I did it. Also it is my first time performing commercial-grade mix. It's fun playing around with my vocals and harmonys, and the benefit of doing mixing on my own is that it will always be the direction that I want it to be (however the drawback maybe the mixing not very creative and further deviated from the arrangement ideas).

In all a groovy funky R&B song, I also made the MV by myself, hoping to distribute my music to more people. Enjoy!
