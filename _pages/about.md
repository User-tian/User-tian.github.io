Hi! I'm Baotong. I am a second-year Ph.D. student at the [Audio and Information Research Lab](https://labsites.rochester.edu/air/), University of Rochester, NY, USA. I am fortunate to work with Prof. [Zhiyao Duan](https://hajim.rochester.edu/ece/sites/zduan/). 
I received my B.E. Degree in Automation from Tsinghua University in 2024. I was also a member of the [Tong(General Artificial Intelligence) class](https://tongclass.ac.cn/author/baotong-tian/). I worked with Prof. [Jiwen Lu](http://ivg.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/Jiwen_Lu/) in [i-VisionGroup](http://ivg.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/) on explainable AI.

My research interests are in Machine Learning and its application in the audio domain. I'm interested in speech processing and MIR (music technology). Currently I'm working on streaming voice conversion, audio deepfake detection and music transcription. I also have some interest in deep learning theory.

## ðŸŽ¼ Musical Experience

I have seven years of experience learning and playing the electric piano, from the age of 5 to 12, and I started learning acoustic guitar at the age of 13. Fortunately, I still practice guitar in my free time.

In addition, I started writing my own pop songs in high school and taught myself music arrangement and mixing in college to try to produce my compositions. I've been selected to join Tsinghua University's Music Dream Programme for the Class of 2021-2022, which is designed to nurture and develop campus musicians. Currently, 7 songs I produced using logic pro are available online on various music platforms.
