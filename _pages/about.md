I am a senior undergraduate student in the Department of Automation at Tsinghua University. I will be receiving my Bachelor's degree from the Department of Automation in 2024. Iâ€™m also a member of the [Tong(General Artificial Intelligence) class](https://tongclass.ac.cn/author/baotong-tian/). Currently, I'm working with Prof. [Jiwen Lu](http://ivg.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/Jiwen_Lu/).

My research interests are in MIR (music technology), particularly incorporating AI in music information retrieval tasks and controllable music generation. I also have some interest in deep learning theory. I'm currently working in [i-VisionGroup](http://ivg.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/) on explainable AI.

## ðŸŽ¼ Musical Experience

I have seven years of experience learning and playing the electric piano, from the age of 5 to 12, and I started learning acoustic guitar at the age of 13. Fortunately, I still practice guitar in my free time.

In addition, I started writing my own pop songs in high school and taught myself music arrangement and mixing in college to try to produce my compositions. I've been selected to join Tsinghua University's Music Dream Programme for the Class of 2021-2022, which is designed to nurture and develop campus musicians. Currently, four songs I produced using logic pro are available online on 2 music platforms in China: The NetEase's Cloud Music & QQ Music.
